# Note 
This program works
 error-free up to 
version 3.0.
For an error-free eur camera app
 launcher use Romfs-Test. 
# 6.2 
has still the camera launch 
function but it no longer works.  
# 3DS-Test-Homebrew
The cc can print text on the Display 
and it can run the eur region 3ds camera
App by pressing the A button. 
The cc is a homebrew app that I have 
Programmed Without 
programming skills. 
So I don't know how to load textures.
# cc.cia
This file exists from version 3.0.
# cc.3dsx 
The 3dsx is the program 
that runs in the hblauncher. 
# cc.smdh
If you want the file
 information to appear 
in the hblauncher, you need
 the smdh in the same 
directory as the 3dsx.
