# 3DS-Test-Homebrew
The cc is a homebrew app that I have 
Programmed Without 
programming skills. 
So I don't know how to load textures.
# cc.cia
This file does not exist until 
a later version. 

# cc.3dsx 
The 3dsx is the program 
that runs in the hblauncher. 
# cc.smdh
If you want the file
 information to appear 
in the hblauncher, you need
 the smdh in the same 
directory as the 3dsx.
